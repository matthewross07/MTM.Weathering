                             shattered bedrock and coal residues, and turn 2 meter deep soils into 100 meter deep spoils. Here
                             we show how these physical impacts to the landscape alter the hydrology and biogeochemistry
                             of two watersheds that have been heavily mined.
                             The study follows a paired watershed approach, where we have two reference watershed that are unmined paired with two
                             watersheds that have been mined. The small catchments (~1km2) are Rich's Branch (RB, reference) and
                             Laurel Branch (LB, 99% mined), while the large ones (35 km2) are Left Fork (LF, reference) and Mud River (MR, 46% mined).
